# Motivation and Contents
In the past, we've referenced [#98](https://github.com/virtual-vgo/vvgo/issues/98) in the Discord server, but that has gotten tiring. This exists to have a documented place for our various score orders, and to give some context to those who'd like to arrange music for consideration as VVGO repertoire.

# Notes for arrangers (rev. 2020-09-19)

VVGO would like to be transparent and forthcoming with our expectations for arrangers and arrangements, and with the timelines and pipelines involved in getting a piece from the "idea stage" to where sheet music is on stands. The VVGO Teams hold themselves to a high standard when it comes to the quality of the preparation and distribution of public materials (sheet music, click tracks, reference tracks, conducting videos, choral pronunciation guides, the VVGO website, etc.). We'd like to shed light on how we consistently achieve this quality, the tradeoffs involved, and what prospective arrangers can do to increase the likelihood of their pieces getting approved sooner rather than later.

We understand that arranging can take a lot of time and personal investment on the part of the arranger--many of us are arrangers and orchestrators ourselves. We realize that the VVGO community has a very wide breadth in terms of instrument availability, and the following score orders reflect that. Since VVGO aims to include as many musicians from as many backgrounds as we can, the score orders may look dauntingly grandiose to prospective arrangers. Keep in mind that these score orders strictly represent idealized scenarios, and are certainly not a deal-breaker for any arrangement. Consider them as goals for orchestration.

The pipeline for arrangements is roughly: (rev. 2021-01-31)

1. **Idea Stage:** Someone has an idea to arrange a piece, and brings it up in the Discord server in an appropriate channel.
2. **Arrangement Stage:** Someone (or, potentially, many people) arranges the piece, keeping in mind the orchestrations listed here. This can be done privately, or can be done via the Discord server as a community arranging project, pending approval from the VVGO Executive Directors. Getting a piece approved as a community arranging project does NOT guarantee that VVGO will perform it, but is considered as a high-priority arrangement due to it being made specifically for VVGO from its community.
3. **Arrangement Submission:** Once the score for the arrangement is done, arrangers then submit their arrangement for consideration as VVGO repertoire via the "Arrangement Submissions" Google Form (available in the #submit-arrangements channel). This requires the inclusion of an audio mockup (i.e. preview), full PDF score, and any notation files used. Arrangers must also specify the "scale" of their piece, by which we mean "What kind of ensemble is meant to play this arrangement, and just how large is that ensemble?"
4. **Initial Quality Check:** Three to four weeks prior to the public recording submission deadline for the current VVGO project, the VVGO Music Preparation Team ("Rep-Prep") meets to listen to the submitted arrangements, plus any arrangements that were not selected previously but were kept in consideration for future VVGO projects. They consider each piece for its technical and logistical feasibility, for its inclusivity, and for its entertainment value. Rep-Prep compiles their thoughts, feedback, and concerns in a document that is sent to the VVGO Leaders.
5. **Executive Directors Vote:** The VVGO Executive Directors meet to discuss the arrangements under consideration, heeding Rep-Prep's notes, and ultimately vote (using a fancy ranked preference system) on what piece(s) that VVGO will perform next.
6. **Start of Pre-Production:** The VVGO Executive Directors inform the Production Teams what piece(s) to prepare for next, and set a goal date to open public recording submissions. The Music Preparation Director(s) invite(s) the arranger(s) of the selected piece(s) to be a temporary member of Rep-Prep for the duration of music preparation, and longer at the discretion of the Music Preparation Director(s).
7. **Adaptation Stage:** The arranger(s) and members of the Rep-Prep team work together to adapt each selected arrangement for VVGO, with the goal of creating a "viable score"--that is, a score that is ready to be sent to an engraver for part preparation, and to the Audio Team for MIDI translation to a reference track and a click track, and in the case of choral pieces, individualized learning tracks for each part. This adaptation stage normally involves expanding the original instrumentation (colloquially referred to as "explosion") to suit as many instruments in the "idealized score order" as is feasible. This stage also involves reviewing each part for technical feasibility, ideally by members of VVGO Teams who play each particular instrument.
8. **Pulling It All Together:** This is crunch time!
    1. The engraver prepares sheet music proofs for each part, which are then reviewed by a select handful of Rep-Prep members.
    2. The click track is sent to a conductor, who works with the Video Team to produce conducting videos and upload them to the VVGO YouTube channel.
    3. The Web + Coding Team formulates the public materials distribution via [VVGO.org](https://vvgo.org).
    4. The VVGO Executive Directors create the public recording submission links and all shortlinks, setting publicly visible deadlines where needed.
    5. The Communications Team drafts announcement posts for Discord and social media.
    6. Someone on VVGO Production Teams posts "clues" for several days leading to the project announcement about what the next piece is to the Discord server and social media, and encourages people to guess.
9. **Project Launched:** The project goes live, and public recording submissions open. Tada! This is usually aligned with the closure of public recording submissions for the previous project.


# VVGO Standard Full Instrumentation (rev 2021-01-31)
It's a bold title, but this is the "ideal" scenario for instrumentation. Finding VGM pieces that fit this bill isn't easy.
